# OWASP Security Misconfiguration

## Introduction
Security misconfiguration occurs when security settings are not properly implemented or left at their defaults, leaving the application exposed to attacks. Examples include:
- Missing or misconfigured security headers.
- Overly detailed error messages revealing sensitive information.
- Enabled debugging or unnecessary features in production.

## Test Cases
- **Security Headers Verification**:
  - Ensure headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and X-Frame-Options are properly set.
- **Error Messages**:
  - Trigger application errors and validate that no sensitive information (e.g., stack traces, server details) is leaked.
- **Application Configuration**:
  - Verify unnecessary features (e.g., directory listing, debug mode) are disabled in production.

## Methodology
1. Use tools like `curl` or `securityheaders.com` to test security headers.
2. Trigger application errors manually or using tools like `Burp Suite` to check error message content.
3. Perform a configuration audit using automated tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP).

## Results
- Security headers are properly configured.
- Error messages are sanitized and do not expose sensitive information.
- All unnecessary features are disabled, and the application is securely configured.

## Actions Required
- Regularly review security headers and update policies as needed.
- Log errors securely without exposing sensitive details to end users.
- Perform periodic audits of the applicationâ€™s configuration.
