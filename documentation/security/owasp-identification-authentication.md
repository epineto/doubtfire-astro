# OWASP Identification and Authentication Failures

## Introduction
Identification and authentication failures occur when an application improperly verifies users' identities or enforces security policies, allowing attackers to bypass authentication or assume other users' identities.

**Examples:**
- Weak or missing password policies.
- Session hijacking due to insecure token handling.
- Authentication bypass via brute force attacks.

## Test Cases
- **Password Policy Enforcement**:
  - Ensure rules for minimum length, complexity, and expiration are enforced.
- **Weak Password Rejection**:
  - Attempt login using weak or commonly used passwords.
- **Session Hijacking**:
  - Verify tokens are secure with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
  - Attempt session fixation attacks.

## Methodology
1. Use tools like `Burp Suite` or `OWASP ZAP` to test vulnerabilities.
2. Simulate session hijacking via cookie manipulation.
3. Validate password policies through registration and login APIs.

## Results
- Password policies successfully enforced.
- Weak passwords were rejected.
- Tokens include secure flags, mitigating hijacking risks.

## Actions Required
- Strengthen session token security by enabling SameSite flags.
- Improve logging to detect brute force attempts.
