# OWASP Vulnerable and Outdated Components

## Introduction
Vulnerable and outdated components occur when software dependencies (e.g., libraries, frameworks, plugins) contain known security issues or are no longer supported. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to compromise the application.

**Examples:**
- Using a library with known vulnerabilities (e.g., log4j, OpenSSL).
- Running an outdated server that is missing critical security patches.

## Test Cases
- **Dependency Vulnerability Scans**:
  - Use tools like `OWASP Dependency-Check` or `Acunetix` to identify vulnerable dependencies.
- **Exploitation Testing**:
  - Attempt exploitation of known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **Version Validation**:
  - Confirm all dependencies and components are up-to-date and supported.

## Methodology
1. Use automated tools like `OWASP Dependency-Check` or `Retire.js` for scanning.
2. Cross-reference detected vulnerabilities with CVE databases.
3. Test the applicationâ€™s behavior after patching dependencies to ensure functionality remains intact.

## Results
- Dependency scans identified no critical vulnerabilities.
- All outdated components have been updated to secure versions.
- Application functionality was successfully verified post-updates.

## Actions Required
- Regularly schedule automated dependency scans.
- Enforce policies to disallow outdated or unsupported components.
- Maintain an update log for dependencies.
